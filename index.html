            <h3>AUTOMATED CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE SAR-HC ROUTER</h3>
            <p>
            <strong>Innovative automation project</strong> designed to streamline the configuration process for <strong>Nokia SAR-HC routers</strong> by developing a fully web-based tool.  
            The main objective was to create a simple and intuitive website that <strong>any technician could use</strong>, as long as they had the required information—removing the complexity of manual router setup.
            </p>

            <p>
            The first version, completed during my <strong>initial internship at Creos</strong>, successfully delivered this user-friendly interface, allowing teams to generate router configurations quickly and reliably.
            </p>

            <p>
            During the following year, I expanded the project by implementing a robust <strong>InfoBlox API integration</strong>.  
            This enhancement enabled:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatic IP reservation</strong> directly from the tool</li>
                <li>Structured <strong>naming conventions</strong> for consistent resource tagging</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient allocation of available IP ranges</strong> without manual intervention</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            The entire system runs on a <strong>Linux-based Apache server</strong>, combining a frontend built with <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> and a backend powered by <strong>Python</strong>, ensuring smooth communication between the UI and the network services.
            </p>

            <p>
            Originally initiated in my second year of BTS studies, the project matured significantly during my final year.  
            The latest version features:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Enhanced <strong>backend architecture</strong></li>
                <li>More reliable and optimized <strong>API interactions</strong></li>
                <li>Improved workflow tailored to the operational needs of Creos Luxembourg</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            The result is a powerful automation tool that <strong>eliminates manual configuration steps</strong>, reduces human error, and <strong>dramatically accelerates router deployment</strong> within Creos Luxembourg’s infrastructure.

            <h3>INTERACTIVE NARRATIVE GAME (COLLEGE PROJECT)</h3>
            <p>
            <strong>Ambitious game development project</strong> created as part of a programming course, where the objective was to build a complete application using a language of our choice.  
            Our team selected <strong>GDScript</strong> due to its similarity to Python and as a way to challenge ourselves with the <strong>Godot 4.3</strong> engine.  
            The course also emphasized <strong>team collaboration</strong>, <strong>project management</strong>, and delivering a fully functional product within strict deadlines.
            </p>

            <p>
            Developed using the <strong>Godot Engine</strong>, this project combines storytelling, action gameplay, and dynamic systems to create a unique interactive experience:

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic narrative branches</strong> where player decisions influence story progression, enhancing replayability</li>
                <li><strong>Dungeons & Dragons–inspired dice mechanics</strong> introducing strategic chance-based elements</li>
                <li><strong>Platformer gameplay</strong> inspired by classic Mario-style movement: running, jumping, exploration</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            You play as the protagonist of your own story, where every decision has consequences in a world filled with dangers and surprises.  
            The game demands <strong>quick thinking</strong>, <strong>adaptability</strong>, and an understanding of risk through its hybrid combat and progression systems.
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Primary objectives</strong> included:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Building multiple interactive levels with <strong>choice systems</strong> and <strong>dialogue mechanics</strong></li>
                <li>Producing complete and clear <strong>project documentation</strong></li>
                <li>Delivering a fully operational game within course deadlines</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            <strong>Secondary objectives</strong> focused on:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Mastering <strong>Godot 4.3</strong> and <strong>GDScript</strong></li>
